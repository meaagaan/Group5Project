# Group5Project: Mochi


Our product is for software developers who want their software on an easily accessible market for purchase and consumers who frequently purchase software whether for professional or recreational use.

The product is a desktop app that curates a list of software based on categories. Software developers gain access to a preexisting consumer base and a platform to sell their product without having to maintain the method of purchase. Customers gain access to a free, curated list of software available for purchase all in one place.

Unlike purchasing directly from the sellerâ€™s website, the customer can search through many options and price-compare all of the available products. Our product offers an all-in-one solution for consumers to purchase the software they need from multiple developers, and it offers a pre-existing customer base for developers to sell their product without external advertising.
